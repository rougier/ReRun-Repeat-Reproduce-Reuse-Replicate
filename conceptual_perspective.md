# R0: Introduction/Available
* If your code is not available, to you or other, then it is not a scientific contribution. A code that does not run and is available is better than the perfect, unobtainable, code.
* Computer Science is not imprevious from replication problems.

# R1: Re-runable
* Can you run old code?
* Track the running environment. 

# R2: Repeatable
* Set the random seed.
* Dependencies tracking version 2. 

# R3: Reproducible
* Save results and keep track of the random seed/parameters/git commit.

# R4: Replicable
* Allow you results to be reobtained without your code?
* With a different code? 
* What does it means for you?

# R5: Re-usable
* Github, Travis, Documentation, etc.
